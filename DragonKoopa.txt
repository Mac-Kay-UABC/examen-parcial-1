Much for my discontent, I was the only one who could truly appreciate it, in contrast with the rest of people who managed to play it with me, or at least looking at it on the screen. When we usually moved through the first Dragon Koopa's castle. Their gaze filled with illusion and exaltation slowly withered into gaze filled with confusion and fear. I don't know why, but it was like them, unlike me, weren't capable of comprehending what they were looking at. Like the image of that majestic creature was generating them the polar opposite of what it made me feel. When the Dragon Koopa appeared on the screen, just about every time something happened that stopped them from keep playing. Sometimes, they would just go to play outside, would return home or they would start to cry or wail. They would suffer as their naive eyes would get lost at the pixels on the screen. When that happened, I usually got angry, and started to insult them in ways that only children could understand.
