Down on luck, we make our way across the lands
Forever and a day is all that time of us demands

As the hours drift on, hope seems far gone, all around us
Light guns rare and can't compare to all this darkness
No one can tame our past of shame, it's all that we know
Memories of all those things drift through all that we sow

You know a brighter day is just around the bend

What we need is some heroes
With wills of iron
Their hearts in the stars through the darkness of days
They'll ride into the sunset
Hope overflowing
And construct a new day from the bad

I can see the sorrow in all their eyes
Just one more day is what they say to stay alive

There's a pain that we all gain from all this darkness
Look around and see it's bound to every one of us
It seems all we see is misery at the end of our ropes
Let's break this mold and change the old and all begin to hope

You know a brighter day is just around the bend

What we need is some heroes
Made of metal
Some steam powered gunslingers to save the day
They'll ride in with their heads held high
Guns aimed, courage at their side
And vanquish the evil from the lands

What we need is some heroes
With wills of iron
Their hearts in the stars through the darkest of days
They'll ride into the sunset
Hope overflowing
And construct a new day from the bad
And construct a new day from the bad
